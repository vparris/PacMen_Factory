# PacMen Factory

A factory for making pacmen. This will create as many or as little PacMen as the user likes.  

# Useage
Download a local copy from the repo.  You can use the Live Servr extension in VS Code or opening the index.html in your browser will run the program.

# RoadMap
I would like to edit this project in the future to inclue more stylized buttons as well as music.
